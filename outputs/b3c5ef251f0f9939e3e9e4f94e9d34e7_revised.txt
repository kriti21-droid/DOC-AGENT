**Key Concepts: Fair Usage Policy (FUP)**

**Overview**

A Fair Usage Policy (FUP) is a set of guidelines and rules designed to ensure equal and non-discriminatory access to MoEngage resources for all customers.

**Benefits of FUP:**

- Secures your workspace from unregulated external data tracking, maintaining data integrity and user count.
- Ensures fair allocation of MoEngage resources among all customers, preventing data tracking issues caused by improper integrations.

**How Does the Fair Usage Policy Work?**

MoEngage sets data request limits based on recent trends to prevent FUP violations. If a user exceeds the limit:
- Temporary data tracking block for a specific time based on request frequency.
- Permanent data tracking block after three consecutive breaches.

**Fair Usage Policy Limits and Actions**

| Time Interval | Maximum Data Requests Allowed | Action Taken |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| 1 minute      | 100                           | Block data tracking for 1 hour |
| 5 minutes     | 300                           | Block data tracking for 1 hour |
| 1 hour        | 500                           | Block data tracking for 24 hours |
| 1 day         | 1000                          | Block data tracking for 24 hours |

*Note: A user faces permanent data tracking block after three consecutive breaches.*
